Not going to copy all the example code Anothony showed, but the message when dealing with nested callbacks is:

1) Do not use anonymous functions. Declare your functions as named variables on the global scope.
2) When handing potential errors, have your callbacks expect parameters like this: (err, results). That way, if the first parameter is defined, you know there was an error. Stick to that standard. 
3) Generally after you call your callback (let's call the callback 'done'), you want the execution of a function to end. If so, 'return' your call to 'done'.
